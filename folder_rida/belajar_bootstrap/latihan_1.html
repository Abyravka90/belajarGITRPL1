                <p>Finding a way to recover <br>
                    From the bad things happened last month, oh<br>
                    When you finally let go of anything in your dreams, mmm<br>
                    And you feel like you've tried but you can't reach your journey again<br>
                    Give up today is not the way<br>
                    Givin' this up is not the path you need to know<br>
                    It feels like you and me are the same<br>
                    But we're meant to be and we're happy<br>
                    With all of these creatures inside as we try not to cry<br>
                    I think we're the same<br>
                    We are meant to be<br>
                    Inside my heart there's a letter<br>
                    A letter to comeback home for the mess that I've made<br>
                    Dear my body, forgive me for that pain that you've felt<br>
                    Give up today is not the way<br>
                    Givin' this up is not the path you need to see<br>
                    It feels like you and me are the same<br>
                    But we're meant to be and we're happy<br>
                    With all of these creatures inside as we try not to cry<br>
                    It feels like you and me are the same<br>
                    But we're meant to be and we're happy<br>
                    With all of these creatures inside as we try not to cry<br>
                    I think we're the same<br>
                    We were meant to be<br>
                    How long did you take to believe in yourself this time?<br>
                    I still remember how bad I was back then before I met you<br>
                    (It feels like you and me are the same)<br>
                    Cheers to the story of our life, our life<br>
                    Tell me that you're happy now<br>
                    Promise that you'll never ever feel alone<br>
                    I will fix the broken pieces of you, dear<br>
                    The world is cruel but I know you'll be fine tonight<br>
                    'Cause now I'm around<br>
                    I think we're the same<br>
                    We are meant to be<br>
                    I think we're the same<br>
                    We are meant to be</p>
